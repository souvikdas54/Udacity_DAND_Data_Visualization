# GoBike Data Analysis
## by Souvik Das


## Dataset

> The dataset revolves around data collected from BayWheels (formerly Ford GoBike) website. It is a ride-sharing company based in San Francisco Bay Area. The data spans across two years and I have tried to unearth important insights by applying data analysis techniques learned through this course.

## Summary of Findings

> Duration of bike trips was around 5 to 10 mins
> There are more subscribers than customers registered to Gobike system, number of male riders are more than gender and others.
>Female gender spent around 15 minutes per ride, the male counterpart spent around 14 minutes.
> The top 3 stations for the bike sharing service were - SF Caltrain station, SF Ferry Building and Market St at 10th St.
> The duration of bike rides tapers off with rider's age. However the duration of rides are more or less similar across all genders.
> There is a spike in number of rides at the beginning of the year 2019.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Since there are much more subscribers than customers, the team handling subscription strategy must be lauded for their efforts.
> The number of rides taken for different months is not very uniform. The comoany should come up with new strategies during the months showing low number of rides by providing discounts or otherwise to maximize profit.
